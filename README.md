# RDG-USIS
Real-Time, Dynamic, and Highly Generalizable Ultrasound Image Simulation-Guided Procedure  Training System for Musculoskeletal Minimally Invasive Treatment. 

## Introduction
Citation: XXX

Here, we propose a Real-time, Dynamic, and highly Generalizable UltraSound Image Simulation (RDG-USIS) algorithm, specifically designed to enhance training in minimally invasive procedures.

The RDG-USIS:

Our developed ultrasound image simulation-guided minimally invasive procedure training system integrates the proposed RDG-USIS algorithm. It generates high-quality ultrasound images from CT scans (see module indicated by the red circle). It supports real-time, dynamic alignment with other multimodal imaging data, significantly enhancing 3D spatial understanding and surgical accuracy during ultrasound-guided training. 

## Dataset
After the article is accepted, we will open-source the high-quality US-CT dataset that we have designed and collected, which will have a positive impact on the community.
